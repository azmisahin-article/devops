![Azmi ŞAHİN](media/favicon.png)

In this era where technology is evolving rapidly and the business world is becoming more competitive than ever, success and sustainability for organizations depends on the ability to innovate quickly and effectively. That's where the value of DevOps shines. DevOps is an approach that brings together development and operations teams to combine a set of practical, cultural, and automation methods to accelerate the software production process, solve problems quickly, and increase business continuity.

On this journey, organizations not only become more technologically proficient, but they also seize the opportunity to become more flexible, innovative, and customer-centric.

"DevOps is the backbone of AI, which has not yet been embodied."
